# 360Tasks

I'm trying to get my life organized using ToDo-lists, but all tools I found,
and use at the moment miss the big picture. I want to have a ToDo-list tool
considering my whole life, including family, sports, volunteering and hobbies.

The idea is to build a ToDo-list tool which is able to balance the different
life areas, considers my different calendars and supports different task
management methods.
